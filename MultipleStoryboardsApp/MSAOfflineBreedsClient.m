This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat.[1] The breed is not related to the Japanese Bobtail despite the similar name and physical typeâ€”the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different because the mutation causing the American Bobtail's tail is dominant, whereas the Japanese Bobtail tail mutation is recessive.[2]"
